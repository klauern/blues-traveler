# Plugin Architecture Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design for a dynamic plugin architecture to support quick integration of linters, formatters, checkers, etc. The design combines both a plugin interface with dynamic registration and a modular approach.

## Plugin Interface

Define a common interface for plugins:

- `Name() string`: returns the plugin's name.
- `Run(args ...interface{}) error`: executes the plugin.

Example:

```go
type Plugin interface {
    Name() string
    Run(args ...interface{}) error
}
```

## Plugin Registry

A global registry will store plugins in a map:

```go
var registry = make(map[string]Plugin)
```

Functions to implement:

- `RegisterPlugin(p Plugin)`: registers a plugin.
- `GetPlugin(name string) Plugin`: retrieves a plugin by name.

## Integration with Project

- **hooks.go**: Refactor plugin execution by iterating over the registry and executing relevant plugins.
- **main.go**: Setup and initialization of plugins.
- **settings.go**: Add configuration options to specify which plugins to disable/enable.

## Dynamic Registration

Each plugin implementation uses its own `init()` function to call `RegisterPlugin`.

Example:

```go
func init() {
    RegisterPlugin(MyLinter{})
}
```

## Documentation and Samples

- Provide sample plugin implementations (e.g., a dummy linter).
- Write tests to ensure that registration and execution work as expected.

## Next Steps

1. Switch to Code Mode for implementing actual changes in Go source files.
2. Incrementally refactor `hooks.go`, `main.go`, and `settings.go` to integrate the plugin registry.
3. Write additional tests and update documentation as needed.
