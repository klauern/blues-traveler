6. **Clear Naming**: No more hyphen/underscore confusion
7. **Current Status**: All status markers updated to reflect reality

## Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Total Files | 14 | 5 | -64% |
| Custom Hooks Docs | 2 | 1 | -50% |
| Architecture Docs | 2 | 1 | -50% |
| Cursor Docs (active) | 5 | 1 | -80% |
| Migration Docs (active) | 2 | 0 | -100% |

## Git Statistics

- **Renamed**: 5 files (preserves history)
- **Deleted**: 5 files (merged or redundant)
- **Added**: 2 files (new consolidated docs + rule)
- **Modified**: 3 files (updates and merges)

## Documentation Principles Established

1. **One Topic = One File**: Each topic has exactly one canonical file
2. **Archive, Don't Delete**: Historical content preserved with context
3. **Clear Naming**: Consistent naming (hyphens, lowercase)
4. **Current Status**: Status markers kept up to date
5. **Cross-Reference**: Link instead of duplicate
6. **Maintenance**: Regular consolidation to prevent sprawl

## Next Steps for Maintaining Clean Docs

1. Follow `.cursor/rules/documentation.mdc` guidelines
2. Check existing files before creating new ones
3. Archive completed planning/migration docs
4. Update index.md when adding new documentation
5. Keep status markers current
6. Consolidate related content regularly
