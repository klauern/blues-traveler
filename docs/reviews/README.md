# Code Reviews

This directory contains code reviews and audits of the Blues Traveler codebase.

## Reviews

- **[Code Review 2024](code-review-2024.md)** - Comprehensive code review conducted in 2024
  - Architecture strengths and core components
  - Implemented fixes (settings precedence, CLI consistency, security)
  - Remaining recommendations tracked in [beads issue tracker](../../.beads/)
  - Code quality metrics and observations

## Using Review Findings

Review findings and recommendations have been converted to actionable items in the beads issue tracker:
