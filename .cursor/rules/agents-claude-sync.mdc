# AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md Synchronization

## Critical Requirement

**AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md MUST be kept identical at all times.**

These files provide the same guidance to different AI assistants:

- [CLAUDE.md](mdc:CLAUDE.md) - For Claude Code (claude.ai/code)
- [AGENTS.md](mdc:AGENTS.md) - For Cursor AI and other agents

## When Making Changes

If you modify either file:

1. **ALWAYS apply the same change to both files**
2. Verify they remain identical after editing
3. Include both files in the same commit

## Verification

Before committing changes to either file, run:

```bash
diff AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md
```

The output should be empty (no differences).

## Common Updates

When updating these files, common changes include:

- Adding new built-in hooks to the hooks table
- Updating architecture documentation
- Adding new development commands
- Clarifying "What NOT to Do" guidance
- Updating file structure information
- Adding new common patterns or examples

## Rationale

Keeping these files in sync ensures:

- Consistent guidance across different AI platforms
- Unified understanding of project architecture
- Same best practices regardless of which AI assistant is used
- Easier maintenance (one source of truth, two files)
