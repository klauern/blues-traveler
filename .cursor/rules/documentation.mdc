# Documentation Guidelines

## Documentation Structure

Blues Traveler uses a streamlined documentation structure to avoid duplication and confusion:

```
docs/
├── index.md                 # Documentation index - DO NOT duplicate structure here
├── quick_start.md           # Getting started guide for new users
├── developer_guide.md       # Complete developer reference (includes architecture)
├── custom-hooks-guide.md    # Custom hooks user guide and implementation notes
├── cursor-support.md        # Cursor platform support documentation
└── archive/                 # Historical documents (completed migrations, old planning)
```

## Core Principles

### 1. Single Source of Truth

- **One topic = One file**: Each topic should have exactly one canonical documentation file
- **No duplicate filenames**: Avoid similar names like `custom-hooks.md` vs `custom_hooks.md`
- **Clear naming**: Use descriptive, consistent naming (hyphens, not underscores)

### 2. Archive vs Delete

When documentation becomes outdated:

- **Archive** if it has historical value (migrations, planning, design decisions)
  - Move to `docs/archive/` with descriptive subdirectory
  - Preserve git history with `git mv`
  - Update cross-references

- **Delete** if it's truly obsolete or incorrect
  - Only if no historical value and not referenced elsewhere
  - Content still preserved in git history

### 3. Migration and Planning Docs

- **Implementation plans**: Keep in `docs/archive/` once completed
- **Research findings**: Archive after implementation
- **Migration guides**: Archive once migration is complete and production-ready
- **Status markers**: Mark clearly as ✅ COMPLETE or 🚧 IN PROGRESS

### 4. Avoid These Anti-Patterns

❌ **Don't**:
- Create multiple files for the same topic
- Use both hyphens and underscores in similar filenames
- Leave completed migration docs in active docs/
- Duplicate architecture/design content across files
- Keep outdated status markers (update or archive)

✅ **Do**:
- Merge related content into comprehensive guides
- Use clear, unique names
- Archive historical content
- Cross-reference instead of duplicate
- Keep status current

## File Purposes

### [index.md](mdc:docs/index.md)
- Navigation hub for all documentation
- Should reference all active docs (not archive)
- Keep descriptions short

### [quick_start.md](mdc:docs/quick_start.md)
- First-time user experience
- Installation and basic usage
- Links to detailed guides

### [developer_guide.md](mdc:docs/developer_guide.md)
- Complete developer reference
- Architecture and design decisions (consolidated)
- Adding hooks, testing, contributing
- **Includes architecture content** (no separate architecture doc)

### [custom-hooks-guide.md](mdc:docs/custom-hooks-guide.md)
- User guide for custom hooks
- Implementation status and technical notes
- Examples and patterns
- **Single merged document** (not split into multiple files)

### [cursor-support.md](mdc:docs/cursor-support.md)
- Canonical Cursor platform documentation
- Installation, usage, event mapping
- **Single source** (planning docs archived after completion)

## When Adding New Documentation

1. **Check existing files first**: Can content be added to existing doc?
2. **Verify uniqueness**: Is there already a file on this topic?
3. **Update index.md**: Add reference to new documentation
4. **Use proper naming**: `topic-name.md` (hyphens, lowercase)
5. **Link related content**: Cross-reference instead of duplicating

## Updating Documentation

- **Keep status current**: Update phase markers, completion status
- **Archive when complete**: Move planning/migration docs after implementation
- **Consolidate regularly**: Merge related content that has grown separately
- **Update cross-references**: When moving or renaming files

## Examples of Good Documentation Hygiene

**Good** ✅:
```
docs/
├── cursor-support.md         # Single comprehensive guide
└── archive/
    └── cursor-planning/      # Historical planning docs
        ├── PLAN.md
        └── RESEARCH.md
```

**Bad** ❌:
```
docs/
├── cursor-support.md
├── cursor_support.md
├── cursor-docs.md
├── planning/
│   └── cursor-plan.md
└── cursor-wrapper-simplification.md
```

## Maintenance Checklist

When reviewing documentation:

- [ ] No duplicate filenames (check similar names with hyphens/underscores)
- [ ] Completed migration docs moved to archive
- [ ] Status markers are current
- [ ] No duplicate content across files
- [ ] Index.md reflects current structure
- [ ] Cross-references are valid
- [ ] Historical content in archive/ with context
