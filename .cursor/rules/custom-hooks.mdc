# Custom Hook Environment Notes

## `FILES_CHANGED` formatting

- Treat the `FILES_CHANGED` environment variable as **space-separated tokens** when
  matching or expanding values in custom hook jobs.
- This mirrors the runtime behavior in
  [`internal/core/environment.go`](mdc:internal/core/environment.go), where the
  environment builder calls `strings.Join(changedFiles, " ")` to populate the
  variable.
- Prefer glob or regex matchers that handle space-separated input (for example,
  `${FILES_CHANGED} regex ".*\\.rb$"`) rather than assuming comma-delimited
  values.
